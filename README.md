# Fabry_hUREC_Transcriptomics
This repository contains scripts for the analysis of bulk RNA sequencing (RNAseq) data from human urine-derived renal epithelial cells (hURECs) in Fabry disease. The scripts cover key steps in transcriptomic analysis, including quality control, normalization, differential expression analysis, and visualization.
